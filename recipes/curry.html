            <h4>Recipe instructions (taken from the book)</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Take the juice from one bottle of Ol' Janx Spirit.</li>
                <li>Pour into it one measure of water from the seas of Santraginus V â€” Oh, that Santraginean seawater! Oh, those
                Santraginean fish!</li>
                <li>Allow three cubes of Arcturan Mega-gin to melt into the mixture (it must be properly iced or the benzene is lost).</li>
                <li>Allow four litres of Fallian marsh gas to bubble through it, in memory of all those happy hikers who have died of
                pleasure in the Marshes of Fallia.</li>
                <li>Over the back of a silver spoon float a measure of Qualactin Hypermint extract, redolent of all the heady odours of the
                dark Qualactin Zones, subtle, sweet and mystic.</li>
                <li>Drop in the tooth of an Algolian Suntiger. Watch it dissolve, spreading the fires of the Algolian Suns deep into the
                heart of the drink.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle Zamphuor.</li>
                <li>Add an olive.</li>
                <li>Drink... but... very carefully...</li>
            </ol>
